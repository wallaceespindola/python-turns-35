Python was created by Guido van Rossum in February 1991. In February 2026, it turns 35 years old -- one of the most remarkable longevity stories in software engineering history.

Few programming languages survive multiple paradigm shifts. Python went through desktop computing, the internet era, cloud platforms, mobile and now artificial intelligence -- and came out stronger after each one.

## Python's Four Phases

| Phase | Period | Identity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Scripting & Academia | 1991-2000 | A cleaner alternative to C scripting, readable teaching language |
| Web & Open Source | 2000-2010 | Django, Flask, startup adoption, Linux ecosystem |
| Data Science & AI | 2010-2020 | NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebooks |
| Platform & Cloud | 2020-present | FastAPI, AI orchestration, universal integration language |

## Why Python Survived

- **Human-centered design** -- readability over cleverness
- **Batteries included** -- the standard library enabled immediate productivity
- **Ecosystem network effects** -- universities, startups and researchers converged around it
- **Low barrier of entry** -- continuously renewing its developer population
- **Adaptability** -- absorbed new paradigms instead of resisting them

## Python vs Java at 30

At nearly the same maturity level, Java (created in 1995 by James Gosling) represents another rare survivor. They occupy different optimization layers:

- **Python** -- optimized for humans (intelligence layer)
- **Java** -- optimized for systems (infrastructure backbone)

They didn't replace each other. Modern platforms frequently combine both: Java for core transactional systems, Python for AI, analytics, automation and orchestration.
