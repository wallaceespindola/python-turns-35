# Python Turns 35: The Language That Refused to Die

Python was created by Guido van Rossum in February 1991. Thirty-five years later, it's more relevant than ever -- powering AI systems, backend APIs, cloud automation and scientific computing worldwide.

This slide deck walks through Python's remarkable journey across four distinct phases, from a niche scripting language to a universal platform. It also compares Python at 35 with Java at 30, showing how both languages survived by optimizing for different things.

## What's Covered

- Python's four evolutionary phases (1991-2026)
- The five factors behind Python's longevity
- Current strong points and where it still has room to grow
- A side-by-side comparison with Java at 30
- Why these two languages complement rather than compete
- What's next for both in the coming decade

## Key Takeaway

Python survived by optimizing for humans. Java survived by optimizing for systems. Together they represent two complementary visions of software engineering -- productivity and reliability.
